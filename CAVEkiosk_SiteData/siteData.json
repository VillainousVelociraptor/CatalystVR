Of particular interest is the existing colors on the columns and ceilings, and the clear graffiti from 1817 and 1818. The overexposed portions of the image were, of course, due to the bright sunlight, and inspired subsequent taking of multiple exposures to attempt high-dynamic range (HDR) captures of scenes like this.
